## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for all the environment variables required and add it to `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

# Athenaverse
It is a NFT Marketplace project. Which is created using smartContract api of Thirdweb. I also used Nft Collection api of Thirdweb. 

This is my first project with backend/Smartcontract. Also this is my first project in Web3. I might have made a lot of mistakes. 
It would be helpful of you to look into it and help me in making this NFT Marketplace project.
